# Night Shift Backlog

This is the steering wheel. The overnight loop reads this file every cycle and
picks the highest-value unblocked item. Keep it current — what's here is what
gets built while you sleep.

**North star: `nightshift/GOAL.md` — maximize pageviews (lever: SEO).** The PM now
picks by expected pageview impact and may *invent* SEO experiments (tagged
`[agent]`) when they beat the backlog, so this list never runs dry. Items below are
still built — they make pages worth visiting — but the goal breaks ties.

## How to add an idea
- Drop it under **Ideas** with a one-line description.
- For design/UX work, add an **Inspiration** entry: a URL + 2-3 bullets of
  *exactly what you like*. Specific likes → on-brand results; "make it nicer" → slop.
- Mark priority with `[P1]` (do first) / `[P2]` / `[P3]`.
- **Mark intent so the allocation policy can route it** (see `GOAL.md`):
  `[want]` = you want it for product reasons · `[bug]` = something's broken ·
  `[goal]` = expected to grow pageviews (SEO/content). Untagged → inferred
  (SEO/content=goal, "BUG"=bug, other features=want). The loop alternates
  `[want]`↔`[goal]` ~1:1, with `[bug]`/blockers always first.
- Big items (map, AI search, comparison) must be **sliced** into shippable
  increments across multiple cycles — one slice per cycle.

## Note to the PM agent
Each cycle, pick ONE scoped slice. Prefer P1s. For multi-cycle items, do the
smallest valuable increment and note the next slice in the CHANGELOG. You may
append your own ideas to the Ideas list with an `[agent]` tag + one-line rationale.
Monetization/ads = build UI only, never activate a paid network (see FREEZE.md).

## Inspiration

- **Hangar67** — https://www.hangar67.com/ — the human likes a lot of its features.
  - Modern aircraft marketplace; study it for listing-card density, saved searches/favorites, filtering, comparison, and map.
  - NOTE: Cloudflare-blocks headless browsers. To study it, use headed/handoff browse mode or work from the human's notes.
- **Controller.com filters** — https://www.controller.com/listings/for-sale/piston-single-aircraft/6
  - Take the *filter taxonomy*, leave the clutter — the human finds Controller "a little busy."
  - Borrow the dimensions (make, model, year, price, total time, engine time, avionics, condition, location); present far fewer at once with progressive disclosure.

## Ideas

### SEO breadth — keyword-researched (brainstorm 2026-06-19)
Keyword signal (Google autocomplete, 2026-06-19): demand centers on **make+model +
"for sale"** (`cessna 172 for sale` → `+california` / `+near me` / `+under $50,000` /
`+used` / `+price`), **geo** (`aircraft for sale california` outranks even `near me`;
`near me` + `near [airport]` on every query), and a **content/tools** seam for
partnerships (`airplane partnership agreement template` / `spreadsheet` / `llc`).
Partnership search < for-sale search (confirmed). `flying club near me` is a real
adjacent query. Build each as a genuinely useful, unique page — obey GOAL.md (NO
thin/doorway pages; real listings + real data per page).

- **[P1][goal] Aircraft-for-sale make+model pages.** `/aircraft/[make]/[model]` (e.g. `/aircraft/cessna/172`): all matching for-sale aircraft + model specs + a cost-to-own blurb. Title `"{Make} {Model} for sale — {N} aircraft | ClubHanger"`. The #1 search pattern. Slice: (1) route + top ~20 make/model combos by inventory; (2) all combos with inventory + add to sitemap; (3) unique H1/meta + JSON-LD (Vehicle/Offer); (4) price & state variants (`{model} for sale under ${X}`, `{model} for sale in {state}`).
- **[P1][goal] Geo "near [airport] / near me" pages.** Planes-for-sale AND partnerships near a location, keyed off the `airports` lat/lng — `/aircraft/near/KHWD`, `/partnerships/near/KHWD` ("partnerships near Hayward airport"). Slice: (1) `/partnerships/near/[icao]` for busiest airports; (2) for-sale variant; (3) a "near me" geolocation landing that routes to the nearest airport page; (4) sitemap + internal links from existing airport pages.
- **[P1][goal] State-level for-sale pages.** `/aircraft/for-sale/[state]` (`aircraft for sale california` is the single top autocomplete); extend the existing partnerships-by-state pattern to for-sale. Slice: (1) all 50 states with real listings; (2) unique titles/meta + sitemap; (3) cross-link make+model within each state.
- **[P2][goal] Partnership tools + guides (content / linkbait).** Hit the informational seam: a free **partnership agreement template** page, a **cost-split tool** (ties to the calculators), and guides ("How aircraft co-ownership works", "How much does it cost to co-own a Cessna 172?"). High-intent, low-competition, earns links. Slice: one asset/guide per cycle.
- **[P2][goal] Flying-club / "near me" angle.** `flying club near me` is real geo demand — a `/flying-clubs/near/[icao]` family (or positioning that surfaces partnerships + clubs by area). Slice: (1) page family off `airports`; (2) content explaining club vs partnership vs share.
- **[P2][goal/want] Shareable listing pages (OG / Twitter cards).** Rich Open Graph + Twitter card + JSON-LD on every listing detail so shared links render with photo/price/specs → referral traffic. Add a "Share" button. Slice: (1) OG/twitter meta + a dynamic OG image; (2) share button + copy-link.

### Planes for Sale
- **[P1] Filter UI overhaul.** Lead with **Make + Model** (the primary search path — Model options depend on selected Make). Then secondary filters: **avionics, total time (tach/Hobbs), engine time (SMOH), year, price, state.** Cleaner than Controller — surface the few that matter, progressive-disclose the rest. Must work at 375px.
- **[P1][bug] real aircraft photos missing.** None of the sale listings show the actual plane photo. Diagnose the whole path: is the Barnstormers ingest capturing image URLs? Are they being re-hosted / stored on `aircraft_for_sale`? Is the card falling back to a placeholder when a real image exists? Fix so real photos render, with the "Not actual plane photo" badge only when genuinely a placeholder.

### Search & discovery
- **[P2] AI natural-language search (beta).** A search box that takes "low-time IFR Cirrus under $400/mo near the Bay Area" → translates to structured filters via Claude (reuse the app's existing LLM/parse layer + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — do not hardcode keys) → runs the query. Label clearly as **beta**. Slice it: (1) NL→filters endpoint, (2) wire to results, (3) polish.
- **[P2] Map view (Yelp-style).** Pannable map; results update as you move the map, keyed to airport lat/lng (already in the `airports` table). **More valuable for partnerships than planes-for-sale.** Big — slice it: (1) static map of current results, (2) markers + popovers, (3) pan-to-search ("search this area").

### Engagement & accounts
- **[P2] Save / favorite listings.** Heart button on cards + detail pages (partnerships AND planes-for-sale). Logged-out click → **registration gate** (sign in/up), then saves to the user's account. New `saved_listings` table; a "Saved" view. Reuse existing auth.
- **[P2] Listing comparison.** Select 2-3 listings → side-by-side spec/cost/requirements comparison. A compare tray + a `/compare` view. Works for planes-for-sale (specs) and partnerships (costs/requirements).

### Partnerships
- **[P2] Merge "Available" + "Seeking" into one toggle.** `/partnerships/seeking` is currently blank. Instead of two separate lists, when searching partnerships show a mix of **available partnerships** + **pilots seeking to form groups**, with a toggle: Available / Seeking / Both. Keep SEO intact.

### Re-filed from the 6/14 feature run — adapt the existing code, don't rebuild from scratch
These shipped as PRs on 6/14 but went stale (35 commits behind staging) and now conflict. The code is a strong starting point: rebase the relevant files onto current `staging`, resolve conflicts, then QA per RUNBOOK. ONE per cycle.
- **[P1][want] Cost + earnings calculators.** Standalone `/tools/cost-calculator` (co-ownership cost split) + `/tools/earnings-calculator` (leaseback earnings). Near-complete in branch `feat/financial-calculators` (PR #17): mostly new isolated files — `src/app/tools/*`, `src/components/CostCalculator.tsx`, `EarningsCalculator.tsx`, `src/lib/calculators.ts` + tests. Only 1 conflict; easiest win. Link in footer/nav. Cleaner-than-Controller, 375px-first.
- **[P2][want] Compatibility matching engine + new-match alerts.** Score how well a seeker fits an available partnership (and vice-versa) from EXISTING columns (budget, home airport + `willing_to_travel_nm` via airport lat/lng, ratings, hours, share type) — NO schema change. Surface "N matches" + a `/matches` view + match badges. Starting code in `feat/matching-engine` (PR #15): `src/lib/matching.ts` + tests, `MatchScore.tsx`, `ListingMatches.tsx`. Pairs with the Available+Seeking toggle above.
- **[P2][want] Listing depth — photo gallery + similar listings.** Multi-photo gallery on the partnership detail page + a "Similar listings" rail. Starting code in `feat/listing-depth` (PR #18): `PhotoGallery.tsx`, `SimilarListings.tsx`. The "richer filters" part of that PR overlaps the P1 Filter UI overhaul — fold it there, don't duplicate.
- **[P3][want] Pilot profiles + reviews/trust.** Public pilot profile pages, verified badge, reviews. Starting code in `feat/pilot-profiles` (PR #16). CAUTION: needs a new DB migration (`0001_profiles_and_reviews`) **a human must apply**, and it wired into the OLD `admin/review` UI since rebuilt into the tabbed admin — redo the admin-side wiring against current code. Slice it; flag the migration in the CHANGELOG for the human.

### Quality — re-QA the original 6/12 audit
- **[P2][bug] Re-verify the 6/12 QA findings against current staging; fix only what still reproduces.** Original audit (`.gstack/qa-reports/qa-report-clubhanger-2026-06-12.md`, shipped as stale PRs #1-7) flagged: a React hydration warning on `/partnerships` from locale date formatting; incomplete "Unknown Unknown" captured listings ranked first; "Send Email" dead-ends on captured listings; seeking empty-state copy ("match your filters" with no filters set). Several may already be fixed by later work (the P1 photo bug + listing-quality grading cover the image/ranking ones). Check each on current staging at desktop + 375px; fix what still reproduces. Do NOT merge the stale PRs.

### Monetization (UI only — do NOT activate; human decision)
- **[P3] Standardized ad placements.** Build reusable, consistently-sized ad-slot blocks (e.g. leaderboard, in-feed, sidebar) with placeholders. Do NOT wire a live paid network — leave activation to the human. Networks to evaluate and summarize for the human (don't pick one autonomously):
  - **Google AdSense / Ad Manager** — easiest, broadest, low traffic minimum.
  - **Mediavine / Raptive / Ezoic** — higher RPM, but need meaningful traffic minimums.
  - **Carbon Ads** — clean, single tasteful ad; good for niche/dev audiences.
  - **Direct / house ads to aviation advertisers** (avionics shops, aircraft insurers, flight schools, brokers, title/escrow) — likely the best fit + highest value for a niche GA audience; a simple house-ad slot the human can sell directly.

---

## Constraints / taste notes
- Keep the **sky-blue accent**; one accent color, no new palettes.
- **Mobile-first** — every change must look right at 375px before desktop.
- **Cleaner than Controller** — the human finds dense filter walls busy. Few filters visible, progressive disclosure for the rest.
- No dark patterns, no fake urgency, no autoplay.
- Monetization, pricing, removing features, brand/logo/nav-identity changes = **ask a human** (FREEZE.md).

## Done
<!-- The loop appends shipped items here with a date + staging link. -->
- 2026-06-19 — **Save / favorite listings — `/saved` view + nav link (slice 2)**: logged-in users now have a `/saved` ("My Saved Listings") page listing every partnership they've hearted (newest-saved first, reuses `PartnershipCard` with filled hearts, graceful empty state + orphan/inactive drop), plus a "Saved" nav link (Heart icon) in the desktop + mobile menus. Logged-out `/saved` → `/auth?next=/saved`. No schema change — reuses the `saved_listings` table from slice 1 (`toggleSavedListing` already revalidates `/saved`). See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T13:03Z. Next: aircraft hearts (extend favorites to Planes-for-Sale + surface on `/saved`) — still blocked on `AircraftSaleCard.tsx` human WIP.
- 2026-06-19 — **Save / favorite listings — Partnerships (slice 1)**: heart button on every Partnership card + a "Save" button on the `/partnerships/[id]` detail header. Logged-out → registration gate (`/auth?next=<path>`); logged-in → toggles a new additive `saved_listings` table (owner-only RLS, mirrors saved_searches), heart shows filled (staging). Fulfills the SignUpGate's "Track listings you're interested in" perk. `listing_type` already accepts `'aircraft'` for a future slice. See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T12:04Z. Next: slice 2 = a `/saved` view + nav link; then aircraft hearts (blocked on AircraftSaleCard.tsx human WIP).
- 2026-06-19 — **Saved searches on Planes-for-Sale**: `/aircraft` now has a "Save this search" button (logged-out → registration gate), and saved searches became marketplace-aware (additive `saved_searches.path` column) so an aircraft search replays against `/aircraft` with aircraft-vocabulary description + a "Planes for Sale" badge on `/searches` — instead of being treated as a partnership search (staging). Reuses the existing `SaveSearchButton`/`saveSearch`/SignUpGate plumbing. See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T11:06Z. Next: slice 2 = email alerts on new matches (the SignUpGate's promised perk).
- 2026-06-19 — Filter overhaul **numbered pages**: /aircraft pager now shows windowed numbered page buttons (1 2 … current±1 … 31) with the current page highlighted + ellipsis, alongside Prev/Next, so users can jump across the 31-page default set (staging). Filters preserved on every page href; price-drops path still single-window. See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T10:03Z. Filter overhaul [P1] now functionally complete; remaining slices (avionics/SMOH filters, real photos) blocked on human scraper WIP.
- 2026-06-19 — Filter overhaul **pagination**: /aircraft now pages through the full filtered set (`?page=N`, Prev/Next, "Showing X–Y of N" header, graceful out-of-range last page) instead of stopping at the first 60 rows (staging). Filters are preserved across pages. See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T09:02Z. Follow-up: numbered page buttons / jump-to-page.
- 2026-06-19 — Filter overhaul **polish**: /aircraft results header shows the true total match count (e.g. "1,856 … — showing first 60") instead of capping at "60+", so filtering visibly works above 60 matches (staging). See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T08:03Z. Follow-up: real pagination.
- 2026-06-19 — Filter overhaul **slice 2**: Max Total Time filter + progressive-disclosure "More filters" on /aircraft (staging). Avionics/SMOH filters deferred — those columns are 0% populated in the DB (ingest gap). See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T07:03Z.
- 2026-06-19 — Filter overhaul **slice 1**: Make + Model dependent dropdowns on /aircraft (staging). See CHANGELOG 2026-06-19T06:04Z.
